# INTREPPPID

This is the documentation for the amino acid sequence-based Protein-Protein Interaction inference method INTREPPPID (**In**corporating **Tr**iplet **E**rror for **P**redicting **PPI**s using **D**eep Learning). INTREPPPID is particularly well-suited to the cross-species use case.

By far, the easiest way to use INTREPPPID is through the `https://PPI.bio <https://ppi.bio>`_ website.
