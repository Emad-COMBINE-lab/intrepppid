Welcome to INTREPPPID's documentation!
======================================

This is the documentation for the amino acid sequence-based :abbr:`PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction)` inference method, :abbr:`INTREPPPID (INcorporating TRiplet Error for Predicting
PPIs using Deep Learning)`. INTREPPPID is particularly well-suited to the cross-species use case.

By far, the easiest way to use INTREPPPID is through the `https://PPI.bio <https://ppi.bio>`_ website.
